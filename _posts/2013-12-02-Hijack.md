##Before the work

I'm not sure if I should have written this page. I'm still having a some problems on the project.

###Hardware preparation

I choose to create a PCB using the Framjack rev.C schematic. It use MSP430FR5969 as the MCU. However, in China it's not easy to get this chip, so it took over one month before the chip sent to my hand.

The original hijack interface for audio 3.5mm 4conn is not on sale anymore(at least I can't find one), but I use another kind with a little reform instead. 

The real board was made like this. And I made the top side pins down for welding the mcu chip again easily.

###Software Environment preparation

The original wiki page from seedstudio advises to build the environment on TinyOS. Luckily I have some experience on this OS environment. But the wiki page advises to download the hex or text files using the BSL flasher designed by the group in Windows.

I have a FET430UIF which uses JTAG other than BSL, and I don't want to waste money on making a tool for downloading the program.

In fact, I notice that the project code on the board does not use the TinyOS core, they just take advantage of the mspgcc tools there. So I choose to build the environment on Windows.

Here is what I do:

	1-Download the newest version of MSP430 flasher, a command line tool for flashing the program to MCU
	2-Download the the newest mspgcc for windows version, this is what was done under TinyOS, now you don't need TinyOS
	3-Download the srec_cat.exe and put it in the hijack root direction. Without it, you won't get a txt file for flashing but you still can use the hex file to flash.
	4-Change the makefile Includes MCU TARGET and any other parameter necessary.
	5-now you can make the files in the hijack root direction and flash the program to the MCU via a BSL or FET.
	
###Android Library

In the corelib project, remember change the MCU type to MSP430FR5969 and re-generate a lib jar. Import the lib to the project you want.

##What is the goal

In fact, I have not build any original android application for the moment. That's why I say in the beginning maybe I should not write this.

The original project was designed to interface iphone via audio. Iphone does not provide a usb or other universal interface, so it's meaningful for iphone app, such as NFC payment application. We know iphone contains no nfc chip and try to make others use its passbook.For the moment, we do find some successful or not application on the subject. 

What I aim at is not that meaningful and maybe have been done by others. I will connect to Zibgee chip to create a remote controller for my Quadcopter.

##Test and check

After the preparation, the most important thing is to test your environment and hardware. I spent almost two days to find my error in welding. And the flasher tool will tell you if the mcu has been welding right.

Besides the mcu part, the energy harvesting parts consist of many NMOS ,PMOS and a transformer.This part must be cheched by a multimeter or oscilloscope. If you can provide the MCU with energy from outside, it does not matter in this part.

The example android codes has one for feqsweep and another for framjack board only under Android4.0 .

This moment My phone is Android2.3.5 version, but I test the app on other's 4.1 version.

##Next Step

I will do it later. Now work on other matters.
