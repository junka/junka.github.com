##Objectives of the project

NARI Corp. & NUPT Edu. cooperation.

	-Zigbee device:based on TinyOS, small on size and energy-efficient
	-Temperatue monitoring on PC and database storage
	-Switch station environment:High Voltage and Radio wave proof
	-A gateway device:Sinknode for collecting data from Zigbee to Ethernet
	-Realtime Alert if temperature high or device broken
	-...

##System Design

![](/img/WSNSystem.jpg)

The *Node1*~*Node32* are device nodes. TinyOS is run on them. The *Sinkode* is another platform which does not have any energy restrict. Both of these two kinds of device can be seen below.
*Node* communicates with *Sinknode* via Zigbee wireless technology. *Sinknode* communicates with PC via Ethernet, it use UIP as the IP stack. 
The system working flow is designed by me and the communication frames' payload are defined by me too.
Here is the system working flow in Chinese. The frames will not be explained.

Explain the flow in a word, device only consumes energy when necessary.

##TinyOS device design

![](/img/device.jpg)

Size 41¡Á30¡Á21 mm. The main function parts are:
	-MCU:MSP430F2618
	-RF:CC2520
	-Sensor:TMP006,DS18B20
This part of the project is mainly carried by other members.
They transplant TinyOS to this platform, and have submit the code to the original TinyOS project.You can find that on github,too.


##SinkNode device design

Size 54¡Á54¡Á27 mm. The main function parts are:
	-MCU:STM32F103
	-RF:CC2520
	-Ethernet:ENC28J60
	-RS485:ADM3485
This part is my work. It takes about two or three months. Thanks to another open source project UIP. The MCU to Ethernet chip part work was transplanted from others' project. The MCU to RF part took some hard time. I tried to communicate STM32 with CC2520 in auto-ack method, but the flash responsible to data exchange always return a wrong format. The almost same code can work well when the MCU is MSP430.
In the end I change the implementation of auto-ack method to software instead of hardware. This platform does not have energy restrict, so TinyOS has not been transplanted to it. And without a OS, the missions are run in TDM ways.

##Monitor Application on PC

This part is my work too. I choose Java and MS-SQL2008 as the solution. In fact, I'd like to use other technology but the other member gave the job a start and I was told to take it over.
At first I change the database to SQLite. But two weeks later when I have to read or write the database in different threads, I failed. So I choose the MSSQL which is the former solution. But maybe I should have tried MySQL.
It took me about one month. The server socket receives data and stores them in database. The GUI reads the database periodically to update the status displayed.
